A Computer Systems lab written in C to simulate caches in a computer.\
\

Files:\
**csim.c**: Takes in a memory access trace as an input and returns the total number of hits, misses, and evictions in a simulated cache. The user can specify the associativity and size of the cache.\
**trans.c**: Transposes a variety of different sized matrices to optimize cache performance based on a certain cache. This program minimizes cache misses.
